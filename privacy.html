  <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
  <p><em>Last updated: <!-- set date --> 28 November 2025</em></p>

  <p>
    Globeography (“the App”) is developed by an individual developer (“we”, “us”).
    This page explains how we handle information when you use the App.
  </p>

  <h2>Information we collect</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Gameplay data</strong> (such as scores, progress, and settings) stored locally on your device.</li>
    <li><strong>Analytics data</strong> (such as anonymous usage statistics and crash reports) to help us improve the App.
      This may be collected via Apple or a third-party analytics provider.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>How we use information</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>To operate and improve the App.</li>
    <li>To fix bugs and understand which features are most useful.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Children’s privacy</h2>
  <p>
    Globeography is suitable for a general audience and does not knowingly collect personal information from children.
    If you believe we have collected personal data from a child, please contact us via the
    <a href="support.html">Support page</a> and we will delete it.
  </p>

  <h2>Data sharing</h2>
  <p>
    We do not sell your personal data. Limited diagnostic or analytics data may be processed by third-party service providers
    (for example, Apple or an analytics provider) subject to their own privacy policies.
  </p>

  <h2>Your choices</h2>
  <p>
    You can uninstall the App at any time. You may also be able to limit analytics collection via your device settings
    (for example, “Share iPhone & Watch Analytics” on iOS).
  </p>

  <h2>Data deletion</h2>
  <p>
    Globeography does not create user accounts. If you contact us for support, we will use your email address only to
    respond to your request. You can ask us to delete your support messages or any diagnostic data we may have received
    by emailing <a href="mailto:support@globeography.com">support@globeography.com</a>. We aim to process deletion
    requests within 30 days.
